# SandboxRPG

This is a project dedicated to the creation of a simple RPG game, developed by a small team. The idea is simple, but for us apprentice programmers it's quite the task. We don't have an original name yet, so suggestions are welcome.

## Building

Maven is used to handle the dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Clone this repository and: `maven clean install`
* Run as a jar using the `-Djava.library.path=lib/natives` parameter.

## Team
